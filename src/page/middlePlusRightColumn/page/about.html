            Welcome to Musical Patterns. The music here
            has <a href="https://github.com/MusicalPatterns" target="_blank">all been
            written in code</a>.
            Each piece exists not a single listening experience but as a family of possibilities
            which you can explore using its controls. Sort of like a tartan generator to get your imagination going.
            Many of them are demonstrations of new musical substrates letting you provide your content and see how it
            behaves in a new world with its strange rules. I think within these worlds you may find new ways to express
            yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I refer to the musical pieces here as "patterns" to lean toward the aesthetics of visual
            texture, toward the aesthetics of mathematics, and away from the aesthetics of
            songwriting. They're brief and repeat indefinitely. The ideas I am exploring include
            spatialization (if you have a VR headset you can experience this dimension of my work),
            unconventional harmony, irrational rhythm, pitch and rhythm circularity, and various
            other illusions and ambiguities.

        <h3>
            Test-driven composition
        </h3>
        <p>
            For this project I have followed a software development practice called test-driven
            development, or TDD. What this means is that I begin by describing new behavior I want
            in the form of an automated test (for example, I might write a test that expects every
            melodic interval to lay within a particular harmonic complexity threshold). The test
            fails at first, of course, because the music does not yet exhibit the desired behavior.
            But then I work on the code for the music itself until the test passes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A benefit of this technique is that once the desired musical behavior is achieved, it is
            thenceforth protected by this test; I can continue to add new layers of complexity to
            the piece, and if any new feature breaks this existing one, the test will fail, alerting
            me to reconsider my approach. The test also serves as living documentation of my earlier
            intentions, explaining what exactly I cared about in an unambiguous way (I can't tell
            you how many times I've come across notes I took in human language which surely made
            sense to me at the time but which are now nothing but gibberish).
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time the test suite grows. Having eliminated my fear of compromising previous
            achievements, I remain perpetually free to experiment. I also open the door to
            heretofore unobtainable levels of complexity. The implementation might seem more complex than is necessary
            to make the sounds come out of the speakers, but since it's all defined from the ground up in terms of its
            essential motivations, it affords for me to later come back and rapidly extrapolate to get new music. In the
            test you may find a hard-coded version of the music that would suffice for someone to hear it, but the real
            magic is how I've incentivized myself to encode my ideas rather than mere pragmatism.
        </p>
        <h3>
            A new aesthetic
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned TDD on the job as a software engineer, but having spent some time now applying
            it to my own music, I've come to believe that the practice has potential to inspire the
            field of music composition. Certainly it's not for everybody, but it is capable of
            breeding an intriguing (dare I say original) musical aesthetic. Music written in code is
            commonplace, and already boasts a distinct aesthetic, but test-driven music goes
            beyond even that.
        </p>
        <p>
            First allow me to review the aesthetics of music written in code. It tends to sound less
            song-like, and that's a direct result of the composing process. Compare it with
            traditional composition: when you start with a blank page of sheet music, you kind of
            have to start at the beginning, at least the beginning of some section. Writing music in
            code, though, you could start by engineering a musical property which is distributed
            throughout the piece; you could spend a whole morning and accomplish a big chunk of your
            work and still not yet have any final material that could actually be heard. It's more
            like designing a wallpaper pattern, starting with a basic outline, filling in with
            increasing detail over time. It's working inwards rather than across, even though one
            always in the end listens to the music across, so it's less intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Test-driving music allows you to work even less intuitively, which leads to even less
            familiar-sounding, less song-like music. The tests enable you to pick back up after
            several months of inactivity. For the past few years I would make the occasional little
            musical experiment in code but did not test-drive it. Whenever I would try to pick one
            of them back up, I found I'd lost too much context on the components of the code, and I
            didn't know how to contribute any further to it. I learned to feel pressured to start
            and finish a composition in a single sitting (for some definition of sitting), because I
            knew once I stepped away, I might as well start from scratch if I had ideas for
            revisions later. Using TDD, though, I don't have to constrain myself like that.
            I can be composing a dozen pieces at once, asynchronously, tweaking them bit by bit over
            long periods of time. I helps me discover surprising connections between them. Also,
            when the mental place you were at before has faded from your mind, it's actually a
            feature, not a bug! It's an injection of a fresh new perspective into things. Of course
            it's still your perspective, but it's a new you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Test-driving has other benefits, too, which contribute to the aesthetic. Forcing
            yourself to describe the behavior you want first in the form of a test ensures you think
            critically and carefully about what you're doing, rather than just slapping something
            together, QA'ing it with your ears and shipping. You don't really understand something
            until you can explain it a couple ways, and that's true even of your own artistic
            impulses; challenging yourself to explain what you want before going for it often leads
            to answering questions about your desires which hadn't yet even occurred to you, leading
            to new variants and musical developments. Also, by following a short cycle of
            testing, implementing, testing, implementing, it reduces the tendency to get fanciful,
            adding anticipatory bells and whistles which aren't subservient to the immediate and
            minimum satisfaction of the goal you laid out in your latest test.
        </p>
        <p>
            Test-driving music is so suited to the way I approach composing myself that it has
            revolutionized my musical creativity. If others are out there who approach composition
            similarly to me, or who might benefit from experimenting with such approaches, perhaps
            TDD would be worth a shot. I just discovered that the page about unit testing in the
            wiki for the SuperCollider platform
            includes <a
                href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/wiki/Unit-Testing-Guide#test-driven-development-redgreen-testing"
                target="_blank">a section about TDD</a>, so maybe it's not too far on the horizon.

            Statement of purpose
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of my goals with this project was to consolidate my musical work under a single
            system. Challenging myself to keep my code clean by abstracting features across my
            patterns is another breeding ground for creativity, as well as means for discovery of
            interconnectedness between my musical thoughts, which can lead me towards greater
            unified compositions. Essentially I am developing my own specialized musical instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            I nonetheless consider this output to be proof-of-concept. Electronic music production
            is not an art I aspire to master. I did not choose to develop this project for the web
            because browsers offer the finest digital audio palette, but rather because they offer
            free and instantaneous content delivery anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using code to organize my musical ideas is having a profound impact on my creative
            process, but the sounds produced here are not how I really want to express myself. I
            hope you enjoy playing with my patterns on this site, but understand that I consider
            them not final products but rather as sketches, one tool among others to help
            communicate my intentions to potential human performers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively planning live performances, so you can reach me here if you are

            The past and future

               target="_blank">Several years ago I drafted a book of sorts (unpublished) which I call "Fun Musical
                Ideas".</a> In its introduction, I wrote that one of my purposes with the book was to "inspire
            technically proficient minds to join me in the creation of the tools needed for musicians to make these new
            kinds of music with". At that time I had not yet learned to write code at the level required to achieve many
            of my ideas, so I was reaching out to others, just hoping I'd get lucky and connect with a sympathetic and
            competent soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, I'm proud and delighted to say that today I can manage the technical stuff myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            This book has 26 chapters, and eventually I plan to represent every idea from it in a
            pattern here. Along the way, I expect to come up with a few more.
